# ExerciseIsFun

## Description
<pre>
The motiviation behind this project was to provide an interactive workout website that would allow an easy to use method for the user to figure out their workout for a particular day. It is intended to allow for not only specifying muscle groups but also the exercises that work those groups and utilize videos to assit a user in figuring out how to safely and correctly accomplish the exercise.

The problem that this website solves is greatly increasing the efficiency of deciding on a workout as well as educating the user. It does so in a clean, simple, and motivating manner. In the process of creating this website we learned how to utilize a css framework that we were not practiced in coupled with importing data from multiple APIs and utilizing that data interactively within our website.

Clicking on Create will present the user with a modal that will allow the user to select a finer subset of areas to work as well as allow them to search for specific exercises. This will present the user with options that will allow them to customize their workout manually, this modal has 3 buttons as well, these being Clear Exercises, which will allow a user to remove all of their selections and start again, Submit Exercises, which will add the selected exercises to their presented plan, and Exit which will simply close the modal.
